I build software the way enterprises *wish* it was built: clear boundaries, measurable outcomes, and boring reliability. Most of my serious work lives behind closed doors, so this profile is a curated mirror—reference implementations, architectural patterns, and operational playbooks that translate real constraints into shippable systems. Read between the lines and you’ll see the throughline: clean interfaces, tight feedback loops, and infrastructure that does not lie.
